### Introduction

This BCR describes a standard and interoperable implementation of [Shamir's SecretSharing (SSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing). SSS splits a master secret, such as the master seed S for Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets described in [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), into unique parts which can be distributed among participants. A specified minimum number of parts is required to be supplied in order to reconstruct the original secret. Knowledge of fewer than the required number of parts does not leak information about the master secret.

This document specifies a native CBOR encoding for Shamir Secret Sharing shards, as well as a Uniform Resource [UR](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) type `crypto-sskr` (CBOR tag #6.309).

### ⚠️ Incompatible with SLIP-39

This specification is based on [SLIP-39](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md), developed by SatoshiLabs. The fields of the CBOR structure defined herein are based on SLIP-39, but this specification is **NOT** compatible with SLIP-39.

At first glance, [BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) and SLIP-39 both appear to be means of converting a binary seed to a set of backup words and back. You might assume you could simply convert a BIP-39 backup to a binary seed, from that binary seed to SLIP-39, and then use the SLIP-39 backup to recover the same wallet as the original BIP-39 backup, but this is **NOT** the case. This is because the SLIP-39 algorithm that SatoshiLabs uses in their Trezor wallet does not derive the master secret in the same way as their BIP-39 algorithm does.

As SLIP-39 is not round-trip compatible with BIP-39, and SLIP-39 is under the control of SatoshiLabs and does not appear to be a fully community-controlled standard, Blockchain Commons is no longer endorsing SLIP-39.

This proposal, SSKR, is an alternative to SLIP-39 that allows round-trips with BIP-39. We want to ensure that the same seed will result in the same derived keys using either BIP-39 or SSKR.

* This issue is being tracked [here](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit/issues/38).

Unlike SLIP-39, which incorporates an integral algorithm for converting shards to and from a sequence of backup words, including a checksum, this proposal only specifies the CBOR encoding of such shards. The above goals and others incluing optimization for QR codes are delegated to the [UR (Uniform Resource)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) and [Bytewords](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-012-bytewords.md) specifications.

Also unlike SLIP-39, which incorprates an algorithm to encrypt the master secret according to a password, and also includes provisions for separately encrypting each share secret according to a set of separate passwords, SSKR elides this functionality. Blockchain Commons believes that encryption of master secrets and/or shares should be part of a separate specification applied at a higher level. That is, encryption of a master secret, if desired, should take place before being handed off to an algorithm like BIP-39 or SSKR. Share encryption, if desired should be applied after SSKR generates the shares, and before it combines them.

### CDDL

The following specification is written in Concise Data Definition Language [CDDL](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8610).

It is desirable that shards be of minimal size to facilitate their distribution as sequences of Bytewords. We therefore pack most the metadata for the shard and the share data itself into a single byte string and express the structure as a CBOR byte string.

The single element of this structure is a byte string whose first five bytes consist of the `data` field below, followed by the `share-value` field.

These size optimizations still allow the encoded structure to be well-formed CBOR, be self-identifying, and contain a checksum (provided by Bytewords).

```
crypto-sskr = bytes
```

Bit fields of `data` field:

```
pack the id, group and member data into 5 bytes:
76543210        76543210        76543210
        76543210        76543210
----------------====----====----====----
identifier: 16
                group-threshold: 4
                    group-count: 4
                        group-index: 4
                            member-threshold: 4
                                reserved (MUST be zero): 4
                                    member-index: 4
```

#### Field descriptions:

The following is adapted from [SLIP-39](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md).

* `identifier` (id) is a random 16-bit value which is the same for all shares and is used to verify that the shares belong together; it is also used as salt in the encryption of the master secret.
* `group-threshold` (Gt) indicates how many group shares are needed to reconstruct the master secret. The actual value is encoded as Gt = GT − 1, so a value of 0 indicates that a single group share is needed (GT = 1), a value of 1 indicates that two group shares are needed (GT = 2) etc.
* `group-count` (g) indicates the total number of groups. The actual value is encoded as g = G − 1.
* `group-index` (GI) is the x value of the group share.
* `member-threshold` (t) indicates how many member shares are needed to reconstruct the group share. The actual value is encoded as t = T − 1.
* `member-index` (I) is the x value of the member share in the given group.
* `share-value` (ps) corresponds to a list of the SSS part's f_k(x) values, 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Each f_k(x) value is encoded as a string of eight bits in big-endian order. The concatenation of these bit strings is the share value. Unlike SLIP-39 this value is not padded.
* Unlike SLIP-39, we do not include a checksum at this level, because the Bytewords encoding provides a checksum.

### Example/Test Vector

* The original master secret:

```
7daa851251002874e1a1995f0897e6b1
```

* The SSKR shares for 2 groups: the first group requires 2 of 3 shares and the second group requires 3 of 5 shares. The group threshold is 2, meaning shares from both groups must be met.
* The SSS algorithm uses a random number generator to produce the shares, thus the algorithm is not expected the same shares every time for a given master secret.
